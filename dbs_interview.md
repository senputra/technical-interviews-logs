# DBS Interview 2021

SEED PROGRAMME 2022 Questions.

## Format and advice
You will be given a bunch of questions do read the entire question carefully as the explanation are not as nicely formatted as those big tech companies (eg. Google). Especially when it comes to your tasks.
It is always good practice to print your output for your inputs to get a clear idea of what you are receiving.

## Questions
### Round 1
You will face a few things.
1. Problem solving questions (revise your PSLE math)
2. Programming Concept Questions (More than just OOP and syntaxes). You need to know Computer Architecture and Computer Systems Engineering. Do not look down on these concepts because once you learn, they bring you far anywhere you go for a tech role. 
3. Two coding questions.

Coding Question:
- Finding repeated element:
If there's a repeated element in the array, return "happy" else return "sad"

- Give a happily sorted array:
To obtain a happily sorted array, only one element has to be removed and then the integers are arranged in ascending order to obtain the happily sorted array. 
Objective: count the number of ways to obtain a happily sorted array. In this after removing one element, you can only do shifting of the elements.

Input: 12354
